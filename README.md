# specrend.js

A lightly modified JavaScript implementation of the same program by John Walker originally in C from 1996.

This version was written with the sole focus of converting a light wavelength to an RGB value. 

The returned value from ```wavelength_to_rgb``` is an object containing the r,g,b values as well as a boolean flag indicating whether the value was approximated from a colour outside the gamut.
